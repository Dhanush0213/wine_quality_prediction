# Wine Quality Prediction using Linear Regression

Welcome to the Wine Quality Prediction project! In this repository, we use a Linear Regression model to predict the quality of wines based on various features.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to predict the quality of wines based on specific attributes. This is a classic regression problem, and we've chosen Linear Regression as our model of choice due to its simplicity and interpretability.

## Dataset

We've used the popular Wine Quality dataset, which contains information about various attributes of wines, such as acidity, pH, alcohol content, etc., along with a quality rating. You can find the dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality).

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install them using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Files

- `wine_quality_prediction.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the main code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-quality-prediction.git
cd wine-quality-prediction
```

2. Open and run the `wine_quality_prediction.ipynb` notebook in your Jupyter environment or any Python IDE of your choice.

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to load and preprocess the data, train the Linear Regression model, and evaluate its performance.

4. Feel free to experiment with different features, hyperparameters, or even try other regression models for comparison.

## Results

After running the notebook, you should see the model's predictions and evaluation metrics. These metrics will give you an idea of how well the Linear Regression model is performing in predicting wine quality.
